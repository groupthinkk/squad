        <h3>PLEASE READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS</h3>

        <section class="intro">
            <h4>During this HIT, you’ll be presented with pairs of Instagram posts.</h4>
            <h4>Your challenge is to guess which ones received more “likes”.</h4>
            <h4>You indicate which of the posts you think got more likes by clicking on it or hitting the LEFT or RIGHT arrow.</h4>

            <p>You’ll be asked to review 30 pairs. A timer will help make sure you don’t spend more than 10 seconds per pair. Most people find that each comparison takes a few seconds, so the entire HIT shouldn’t take more than a minute or two.</p>
            <p>If you have any issues with this HIT (or just want to give us feedback) please message us!</p>
